# Cloudflare Tunnel env for docker-compose.tunnel.yml

# Obtain this from Cloudflare Dashboard → Zero Trust → Tunnels → Create tunnel → "Use a token"
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=

# The public hostname you will publish (must exist in your Cloudflare zone, proxied "orange cloud")
# Example: crypto.esense.no
HOSTNAME=crypto.esense.no

# Notes
# - Create a proxied DNS record in Cloudflare for HOSTNAME (orange cloud)
# - No router port-forwarding is needed; cloudflared will egress the connection
# - Keep your wallet-agent .env in .env.production alongside this file

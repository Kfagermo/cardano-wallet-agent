# AI-Powered Wallet Analysis Guide

## Overview

Your Cardano Wallet Health & Risk Scoring Agent now includes **true AI reasoning** using OpenAI's GPT models. This transforms your agent from simple rule-based analysis to intelligent, multi-perspective risk assessment.

## Why AI Analysis Matters for Masumi

According to Masumi guidelines, AI agents should:
1. **Reason from multiple perspectives** (security, DeFi, behavioral, compliance)
2. **Provide nuanced insights** beyond simple if/else rules
3. **Adapt to context** (new wallets aren't automatically risky)
4. **Generate actionable recommendations** for users

Your previous deterministic approach was **not true AI** - it was just rules. Now you have real intelligence.

## Three Analysis Modes

### 1. OpenAI Mode (Recommended)

**Single AI agent** using GPT-4o-mini for cost-efficient, intelligent analysis.

**How it works**:
- Sends wallet data to OpenAI API
- AI analyzes from 4 perspectives: security, DeFi, behavioral, compliance
- Returns risk score (0-100), health category, and specific insights
- Falls back to deterministic if API fails

**Cost**: ~$0.0001-0.0003 per analysis (negligible)

**Setup**:
```bash
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
railway variables set AI_ANALYSIS_MODE="openai"
```

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "risk_score": 23,
  "health": "safe",
  "reasons": [
    "Wallet shows stable staking behavior for 682 days, indicating long-term commitment",
    "Diverse counterparty interactions (0.72) suggest healthy ecosystem participation",
    "Moderate transaction velocity (14 tx/30d) is typical for active holders",
    "No suspicious patterns or known malicious associations detected"
  ],
  "analysis_mode": "openai"
}
```

### 2. CrewAI Mode (Advanced)

**Multi-agent system** with 5 specialized AI agents collaborating:

1. **Security Analyst**: Identifies threats and vulnerabilities
2. **DeFi Analyst**: Assesses protocol risks and leverage
3. **Behavioral Analyst**: Evaluates transaction patterns
4. **Compliance Analyst**: Checks regulatory concerns
5. **Risk Synthesis Manager**: Combines all findings

**How it works**:
- Each agent analyzes wallet independently
- Agents collaborate and debate findings
- Synthesis manager produces final assessment
- More thorough but slower and costlier

**Cost**: ~$0.001-0.003 per analysis (5x OpenAI mode)

**Setup**:
```bash
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
railway variables set AI_ANALYSIS_MODE="crewai"
```

**Use cases**:
- High-value wallets requiring deep analysis
- B2B customers paying premium prices
- Compliance-critical assessments

### 3. Deterministic Mode (Fallback)

**Rule-based analysis** (your original logic). No AI, no API costs.

**When used**:
- `AI_ANALYSIS_MODE=deterministic` explicitly set
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` not configured
- AI analysis fails (automatic fallback)

**Pros**: Free, fast, predictable
**Cons**: No real intelligence, limited insights

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create account or sign in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy key (starts with `sk-...`)

**Cost**: OpenAI charges per token. With GPT-4o-mini:
- Input: $0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: $0.60 per 1M tokens
- **Your cost per analysis**: ~$0.0001-0.0003

**Budget**: $5 credit = ~15,000-50,000 analyses

### Step 2: Configure Railway

```bash
# Set OpenAI API key
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."

# Choose analysis mode
railway variables set AI_ANALYSIS_MODE="openai"

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Step 3: Verify AI is Working

```bash
# Get your Railway URL
RAILWAY_URL=$(railway domain)

# Check AI status
curl https://$RAILWAY_URL/

# Look for:
# "ai": {
#   "mode": "openai",
#   "enabled": true,
#   "available_modes": ["openai", "crewai", "deterministic"]
# }
```

### Step 4: Test AI Analysis

```bash
# Start a job
curl -X POST https://$RAILWAY_URL/start_job \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input_data": [
      {"key": "address", "value": "addr1qx2kd28nq8ac5prwg32hhvudlwggpgfp8utlyqxu6wqgz62f79qsdmm5dsknt9ecr5w468r9ey0fxwkdrwh08ly3tu9sy0f4qd"},
      {"key": "network", "value": "preprod"}
    ]
  }'

# Get result
curl "https://$RAILWAY_URL/status?job_id=YOUR_JOB_ID"

# Check for "analysis_mode": "openai" in result
```

## AI Analysis Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. User calls /start_job
   ↓
2. Fetch on-chain data (Blockfrost)
   ↓
3. Build AI prompt with wallet data
   ↓
4. Call OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini)
   ↓
5. AI analyzes from 4 perspectives
   ↓
6. Parse JSON response
   ↓
7. Validate and return (risk_score, health, reasons)
   ↓
8. Cache result for 24 hours
```

### AI Prompt Structure

**System Prompt** (defines AI's role):
```
You are an expert Cardano blockchain analyst specializing in wallet risk assessment.

Analyze from 4 perspectives:
1. Security Risk: Suspicious patterns, malicious actors
2. DeFi Risk: Leverage, impermanent loss, protocol vulnerabilities
3. Behavioral Risk: Transaction velocity, counterparty diversity
4. Compliance Risk: Mixing services, sanctioned entities

Risk Score Scale (0-100):
- 0-33: Safe (low risk, stable patterns)
- 34-66: Caution (moderate risk, needs monitoring)
- 67-100: Risky (high risk, avoid interaction)

Output JSON:
{
  "risk_score": <0-100>,
  "health": "<safe|caution|risky>",
  "reasons": ["<insight 1>", "<insight 2>", ...],
  "perspectives": {
    "security": "<assessment>",
    "defi": "<assessment>",
    "behavioral": "<assessment>",
    "compliance": "<assessment>"
  }
}
```

**User Prompt** (wallet data):
```

```

### AI Response Example

```json
{
  "risk_score": 23,
  "health": "safe",
  "reasons": [
    "Wallet demonstrates stable staking behavior for 682 days, indicating long-term commitment to the network",
    "High counterparty diversity (0.72) suggests healthy ecosystem participation rather than isolated activity",
    "Moderate transaction velocity (14 tx/30d) is typical for active holders and not indicative of bot behavior",
    "Known label 'exchange' adds credibility and reduces risk of malicious activity",
    "No red flags detected in token holdings or transaction patterns"
  ],
  "perspectives": {
    "security": "Low risk. No suspicious patterns or known malicious associations. Exchange label adds trust.",
    "defi": "Minimal DeFi exposure. Staking is low-risk activity. Token holdings appear standard.",
    "behavioral": "Healthy behavior. Consistent staking, moderate activity, diverse counterparties.",
    "compliance": "Low concern. Exchange label suggests regulated entity. No mixing service indicators."
  }
}
```

## Cost Analysis

### OpenAI Mode

**Per Analysis**:
- Input tokens: ~500 (wallet data + prompt)
- Output tokens: ~200 (AI response)
- Cost: ~$0.0002 per analysis

**Monthly Costs** (based on SURVIVAL_PLAN.md targets):
- 100 analyses/month: $0.02
- 300 analyses/month: $0.06
- 1,000 analyses/month: $0.20

**With Caching** (24-hour TTL):
- Cache hit rate: ~60-80% for popular addresses
- Effective cost: ~$0.04-0.08/month for 300 analyses

**Gross Margin**:
- Revenue: 300 analyses × 0.05 ADA × $0.50/ADA = $7.50/month
- AI cost: $0.06/month
- Blockfrost cost: ~$0-9/month (free tier → starter)
- **Margin**: >90%

### CrewAI Mode

**Per Analysis**:
- 5 agents × 500 input tokens = 2,500 tokens
- 5 agents × 200 output tokens = 1,000 tokens
- Cost: ~$0.001-0.003 per analysis

**Use sparingly** for high-value customers or premium tier.

### Deterministic Mode

**Cost**: $0 (no API calls)

**Use for**:
- Development/testing without API costs
- Fallback when OpenAI is down
- Users who opt out of AI analysis

## Comparison: Deterministic vs AI

### Deterministic Analysis (Old)

```python
# Simple if/else rules
if age_days >= 365:
    score -= 10
    reasons.append("address is older than 1 year")
elif age_days < 30:
    score += 10
    reasons.append("new address (<30 days)")
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "risk_score": 42,
  "health": "caution",
  "reasons": [
    "address is older than 1 year",
    "delegated/staked ADA adds stability",
    "low recent tx activity",
    "diverse counterparties",
    "known label: exchange"
  ]
}
```

**Problems**:
- Generic insights ("address is older than 1 year" - so what?)
- No context (new wallet could be legitimate business)
- No nuance (high tx velocity = bad? Not always!)
- Not true AI reasoning

### AI Analysis (New)

**Output**:
```json
{
  "risk_score": 23,
  "health": "safe",
  "reasons": [
    "Wallet demonstrates stable staking behavior for 682 days, indicating long-term commitment to the network",
    "High counterparty diversity (0.72) suggests healthy ecosystem participation rather than isolated activity",
    "Moderate transaction velocity (14 tx/30d) is typical for active holders and not indicative of bot behavior",
    "Known label 'exchange' adds credibility and reduces risk of malicious activity"
  ],
  "perspectives": {
    "security": "Low risk. No suspicious patterns detected.",
    "defi": "Minimal DeFi exposure. Staking is low-risk.",
    "behavioral": "Healthy behavior. Consistent staking, moderate activity.",
    "compliance": "Low concern. Exchange label suggests regulated entity."
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Contextual**: Explains WHY 682 days matters (long-term commitment)
- **Nuanced**: Recognizes 14 tx/30d is normal for active holders
- **Multi-perspective**: Security, DeFi, behavioral, compliance
- **Actionable**: Specific insights users can act on
- **True AI**: Reasoning, not just rules

- API cost spike (rate limiting issue?)
- Fallback rate > 10% (investigate errors)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Analysis Not Working

**Symptom**: `"analysis_mode": "deterministic"` in results

**Check**:
1. Is `OPENAI_API_KEY` set?
   ```bash
   railway variables get OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

2. Is `AI_ANALYSIS_MODE` correct?
   ```bash
   railway variables get AI_ANALYSIS_MODE
   # Should be "openai" or "crewai"
   ```

3. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   railway logs | grep ai_analysis_failed
   ```

### OpenAI API Errors

**Error**: `"error": "Incorrect API key provided"`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify key format (starts with sk-proj- or sk-)
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
railway up
```

**Error**: `"error": "Rate limit exceeded"`

**Fix**:
- Upgrade OpenAI plan (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing)
- Or reduce analysis frequency (increase cache TTL)

**Error**: `"error": "Insufficient quota"`

**Fix**:
- Add credits to OpenAI account
- Or temporarily switch to deterministic mode:
  ```bash
  railway variables set AI_ANALYSIS_MODE="deterministic"
  ```

### CrewAI Installation Issues

**Error**: `ImportError: No module named 'crewai'`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Ensure requirements.txt includes CrewAI
pip install crewai langchain-openai

# Or rebuild Railway deployment
railway up --detach
```

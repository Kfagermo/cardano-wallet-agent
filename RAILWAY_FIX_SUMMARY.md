# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
Railway sets `$PORT` as an environment variable, but our Dockerfile CMD wasn't properly expanding it.

## Solution
According to Railway docs (https://docs.railway.com/guides/healthchecks):
- Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable
- App must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Healthchecks are optional but recommended

## What We Need to Do

### Option 1: Use Nixpacks (Recommended by Railway)
Railway's Nixpacks automatically handles PORT correctly for Python apps.

**Steps**:
1. Delete or rename `Dockerfile` to `Dockerfile.backup`
2. Railway will auto-detect Python and use Nixpacks
3. Nixpacks automatically handles `$PORT`

### Option 2: Fix Dockerfile (Current approach)
Use a shell script that properly expands `$PORT`.

**Current fix**: Using `start.sh` script

### Option 3: Use Railway's Native Python Support
Let Railway detect Python automatically without Docker.

## Recommended: Switch to Nixpacks

This is the simplest solution. Let me implement it now.
